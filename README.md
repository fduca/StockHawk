# StockHawk
Stock Hawk project implementation from the Udacity Android Nanodegree program https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801. 

## Project description
In this project, you will productionize an app, taking them from a functional state to a production-ready state. To do this, you will find and handle error cases, add accessibility features, allow for localization, add widgets, and add a library.

## Getting started
1.Clone the project in your computer
2.Open the project using Android Studio (File->Open...->Choose the directory where you have clone the project)
3.Build the project (Build->Rebuild the project)
4.Start the application

## Things to know before you launch the application
The application has been uploaded on github without the API key. t's highly unsafe (and often breaks the Terms of Service) to include API keys in public repos, so I need to remove mine. Feel free to insert yours under <tbc>
